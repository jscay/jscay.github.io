                        <h1>📚 Academics</h1>
                        <p>The drastic curriculum changes brought on by the pandemic over the last 2 years have drawn close attention to the need for equitable access to learning materials, along with fair and transparent assessment standards and requirements for course progression.</p>

                        <p><u>Your needs and views are my priority.</u> I will work closely with the academic VP and their team of year level academic representatives to ensure that you are represented at every discussion, whether it’s with faculty or with other key medical stakeholders.</p>
                      
                        <p>
                          My key priorities in the academic space include:
                        </p>

                           <ul>
                            <li>Continued advocacy for <u>fair and equitable assessment standards</u>, particularly considering the disruption to teaching and clinical placements that have affected every single medical student 
                            </li>
                            <li>Working with faculty to provide more, and better, academic resources, with the view that access to academic resources should never be a “pay to win” system

                            </li>
                            <li>Maintaining existing relationships with key bodies – AMSA, MSCV, AMA Victoria, the AMC and PMCV – and in particular, leveraging my experiences (as past AMSA Representative, MSCV Councillor, and AMAVic Council member) to escalate concerns
                            </li>
                            <li>Holding faculty accountable to the student body with <u>greater transparency</u> on decision making processes, more regular communication, and earlier release of timetables and placements 
                            </li>
                            <li>Implementing more transparent and <u>accessible ways to escalate concerns</u> at a hospital site (anything from poor pathology teaching to questionable student facilities #dandenongcouches)
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensuring that student views are identified and used to guide advocacy efforts in the academic space, particularly with current discussions regarding “PGO vs grades”
                            </li>
                            <li>Addressing the steep learning curve between preclinical years and full time hospital placement in year 3B
                            </li>
                            <li>Working with faculty and clinical schools to better standardise learning opportunities, assessments, and attendance requirements across the board
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                        <h1>💓 Wellbeing</h1>
                        <p>It’s disappointing that medicine remains a field that continues to perpetuate poor mental health. Yet even in medical school, there lacks infrastructure that protects the wellbeing of students. It’s clear that much change is still needed in this field, and my goals for the year are to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improve transparency with regard to attendance requirements, and in particular, to advocate for greater leniency on these requirements. “Proof” shouldn’t be the first thing we are expected to provide when we are not feeling well, or when we are going through hard times, and the focus on “professionalism” shouldn’t be used as a weapon against us when we try to advocate for ourselves
                            </li>
                            <li>Introduce <u>“mental health days”</u>, allowing for days to be taken off without any repercussions or impacts on attendance
                            </li>
                            <li>Work closely with the newly established Community & Wellbeing VP and their team of year level representatives to ensure welfare needs at every stage of medical school are responded to and escalated appropriately
                            </li>
                            <li>Continue to ensure the <u>whole MUMUS committee is adequately trained</u> in incident response and able to act as accessible points of contact for any concerns
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensure that faculty’s message of caring for student wellbeing translates into <u>tangible, actionable items</u>
                            </li>
                            <li>Create clearer guides for accessing support, and provide transparency about how concerns are escalated on a faculty level
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                        <p>Social events are so important for bringing a cohort together and sparking new friendships. Events need to be both accessible and safe, and I hope to work closely with the social VP and their team to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Support the planning and running of MUMUS’ key events: O-week, Medball, Halfway party, Graduation ball and End of year party
                            </li>
                            <li>Closely scrutinise student welfare when planning every single event, particularly in ensuring attendees are aware of who to escalate incidents to, and ensuring escalation pathways are accessible even after the event has passed
                            </li>
                            <li>Explore social events that <u>cater to the diverse interests of the student body</u>, utilising venues that may a bit more unconventional or events involving no alcohol
                            </li>
                            <li>Expand the scope of social events to include other Victorian universities

                            <li>Work closely with treasury to continue to direct funds into creating <u>affordable events and improving student experiences</u>

                        <h1>🗣 Advocacy</h1>
                        <p> MUMUS is well-placed for advocacy with a number of key student bodies, and I want to utilise my past experiences with these bodies (e.g AMSA, MSCV) to ensure that Monash’s concerns are heard loud and clear at the table. As an organisation run by students for students, these advocacy efforts should be informed by <u>your</u> needs and priorities. I aim to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Liaise with the MSA to ensure that student supports available Monash-wide are available to students in medicine as well
                            </li>
                            <li>Restoration of the former pre-covid “off-campus” SSAF fees
                            </li>
                            <li>Make better use of the MUMUS annual survey and set up <u>regular MUMUS-run open forums</u> to inform MUMUS’s advocacy priorities and ensure the team is able to represent the student body voice
                            </li>
                            <li>Maintain transparency with all of you with regard to what happens at MUMUS’s meetings, how decisions are reached and what MUMUS’s representatives are up to
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensure no key decisions that affect students are made prior to consultation with the student body (e.g through open forums)

                        <p>Yes! MUMUS has money! (no, not millions) But it’s important that these funds are used thoughtfully in a way that benefits students, and are sustainable in the long-term to ensure MUMUS can continue to serve your needs. Some of the things I’d like to prioritise this year include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Supporting the SSAF officer in accessing SSAF money to deliver value back to the student body, whether it’s through cheaper event tickets, or investments into long term assets
                            </li>
                            <li><u>Greater autonomy for subcommittees</u> over their own funds and accrued profits over time
                            </li>
                            <li>Establishment of a <u>MUMUS grants scheme</u> to help kickstart student initiatives
                            </li>
                            <li>Maintaining and exploring the possibility for expansion of grants and bursary schemes
                            </li>
                            <li>Working closely with the sponsorship officers to solidify sponsorship as a key revenue stream, and to build on the work of 2022’s sponsorship officers to maintain transparency around the role of sponsors

                        <p>There have been many changes made recently to the way MUMUS engages with the diversity of the medical student community. However, it’s imperative that we continue to uplift marginalised voices and ensure these perspectives are incorporated into MUMUS’s decisions and advocacy efforts. I hope to:

                        <p>A strong focus for me this year as secretary has been to support MUMUS’s committee members and its subcommittees to grow in their roles, allowing your representatives to help improve your med school experience.

                        <p>My vision for the committee, our many wonderful subcommittees, and many others that have dedicated their time to helping our student community is to:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Prophylactically prevent volunteer burnout and working closely with the executive team to conduct <u>regular wellbeing checks</u>

                            <li>Make the MUMUS volunteer experience more worthwhile for students, through more explicit upskilling, and increasing visibility to the student body (e.g meet the committee social media campaign, monthly key achievements)

                        <p>I know that my expertise in this field is limited as an undergraduate student, but I recognise MUMUS’s failings over many years in ensuring postgraduates students are well represented on the committee, and in catering to the unique needs of postgraduate students. I want to work closely with the graduate VP to:

My goals within MUMUS are to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure that all international placements required for international students to be eligible to practice in their home country continue to be prioritised and facilitated

                        <p>While rural placements can be really great, they can also be isolating, being away from friends and family, living with a whole new group of people, and having a vastly different teaching curriculum to students based at metropolitan sites. For rurally placed students, I hope to:

                            <li>Work with the social and academics teams to make events held in Melbourne more accessible for rural students, which may include looking into the provision of subsidised accommodation at Monash University
                            </li>
                            <li>Address the difficulties with incident escalation at rural sites, particularly with concerns pertaining to student safety and wellness

                            <li>Tackle the isolation faced by students undertaking rural placement, in particular by working with the ERC rural representative, Gippsland rural representative, and the year A academic, social, wellbeing representatives to support all of you!
                            </li>
                            <li>Increase the promotion of major rural events (e.g Gippsland ball) to students based in Melbourne
