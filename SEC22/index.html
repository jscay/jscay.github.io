                            <p>With COVID bringing into focus many of the issues that exist within medicine, there‚Äôs never been a better time to ensure that the structure of MUMUS is set up in a way that supports <strong>each and every one</strong> of you. As a member of the Diversity Consulting Group, I hear your concerns about MUMUS not feeling approachable. Every single person on the committee should serve as a point of entry for the escalation of concerns, and should be upskilled appropriately in tackling difficult issues and working productively with existing reporting structures. I will provide internal training to upskill committee members in utilising escalation pathways, and work alongside the university to ensure essential training (e.g BRIGHT training) is undertaken by all committee members. </p>
                            <p>As someone that has experienced burn-out first hand, and seen the prevalence of burn-out amongst my peers, I know how difficult it can be to juggle co-curriculars alongside the pressures of medicine. It‚Äôs given me a strong understanding of the importance of <strong>systemic burn-out prophylaxis</strong> for our committee members. I will set up clear welfare pathways for MUMUS volunteers to ensure that our volunteers are able to thrive both within and outside of their roles. Building a strong culture of wellbeing, by implementing initiatives like a traffic light system, means that your representatives will ultimately be placed in a better position to advocate for and support <strong>you</strong>!</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0 text-primary">Transparency</h3>
                            <p>Every single student deserves a voice in MUMUS‚Äô decision making processes. I believe that transparency requires <strong>systemic change</strong> ‚Äì in creating more opportunities to engage with MUMUS, improving accessibility of general meetings, and strengthening communication with regard to decision making at committee meetings. </p>
                            <p>From my experiences with running AMSA Think Tanks and my involvement with running open forums as part of the Diversity Consulting Group, I‚Äôve seen the immense value in facilitating spaces in which students can bring up concerns. I want to provide as much opportunity as possible for our community to bring key issues to MUMUS ‚Äì through <strong>open forums</strong>, and upkeep and promotion of the current anonymous form, allowing for <strong>your input</strong> to guide MUMUS‚Äô priorities.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0 text-primary">Collaboration</h3>
                            <p>Through my prior experience as the MUMUS Merchandise Officer, and current experience on the MMO committee, I have found that there is great value in <strong>fostering relationships</strong> between MUMUS, and its subcommittees and diverse portfolios. Strengthening these connections helps provide greater resources for the events, outreach and advocacy done by our amazing groups, and as students we reap the benefits of having smashing events and initiatives!</p>
                            <p>My vision is of structural change within MUMUS ‚Äì pushing for more initiative from the Executive to facilitate and maintain relationships with subcommittees, and to create <strong>clearer pathways</strong> for how MUMUS can support them, including more clarity on accessing funding, collaboration with sponsors, and accessing central support with their events. </p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0 text-primary">Organisation</h3>
                            <p>While I have a broad big-picture vision for Secretary in 2022, I‚Äôm also avidly aware of the core day-to-day responsibilities of the Secretary in keeping the cogs within MUMUS turning smoothly. As someone that is fuelled by Google Calendar and Slack, I know that I am equipped with the organisational skills and experience to manage the logistical side of the organisation (I love logs <3)</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>As AMSA Representative, I‚Äôve coordinated and upskilled 26 policy review teams, bringing together nearly 60 students spanning from all year levels.</li>
                                <li>As Senior Residential Advisor, I have been a key driver in the adoption of Slack within the Residential Support Team, and been responsible for the chairing of meetings.</li>
                                <li>As AMSA ISN Vice Chair Internal, I served on the Executive Committee, managed the internal operations of the team, and developed new procedures to preserve and build on institutional memory.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Equipped with the above experiences, I will be able to bring my vision for Secretary to life whilst keeping the operational side of MUMUS running like clockwork.</p>
                            <p>Thank you for reading, it would be my absolute pleasure to serve as MUMUS Secretary in 2022! üé∑üêõ</p>
